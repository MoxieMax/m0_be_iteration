# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  * Fairly confident. I could definitely use more practice, but I found that talking it through out loud with my wife really helped me to get through it faster and more accurately than just trying to brute force it by memory.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * Definitely productive. I tried a few different things that didn't work, mostly because of syntax, but eventually for to a functional solution.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I definitely need to try some more scenarios, possibly the ones we did in class, to see if I can replicate the results we were able to get. I can do that tonight or tomorrow before class if I finish the other homework with enough time.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * Not at this time.
